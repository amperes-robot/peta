	\subsection{Rear Wheel Torque}
	From Solidworks' analysis of our CAD models, we have an upper bound $m$ of 5~kg on the assembly's weight. The height $h_G$ of the centre of gravity $G$ off the ground is 0.144~m. The horizontal distance $l_A$ from the back (driven) wheels at $A$ to $G$ is 0.085~m. The horizontal distance $l_B$ from the front support at $B$ to $G$ is 0.134~m. From our measurements, the ramp has an incline of 14$^\circ$. Applying force and moment balancing equations on a static body,
